<p>This is a random paragraph to test various kinds of changes. From one revision to the next, I plan to change <span class='remove capitalize'>c</span><span class='add capitalize'>C</span>apitalization, punctuation, maybe transpose a<span class='add '>select</span>few<span class='remove '>select</span>words, and <span class='remove diacritic'>o</span><span class='add diacritic'>ö</span>therw<span class='remove diacritic'>i</span><span class='add diacritic'>í</span>se m<span class='remove '>ung</span>e<span class='add '>ss with</span> the text. This will pave the way for Chris H<span class='remove punctuation'>'</span><span class='add punctuation'>’</span>s fantastic styling to call out the changes in an entertaining and educational way. Who<span class='remove punctuation'>'</span><span class='add punctuation'>’</span>s with me?</p> <p>We also need to take into account <em>styling changes</em>, which might get confusing when trying to wrap changes in HTML elements. For instance, I might want to change something<span class='remove '>outside</span><span class='add '>around</span><em>and<span class='remove '>inside</em></span><span class='add '>within</em></span>an element at the same time. While the browsers will probably be able to deal with badly nested elements, it<span class='remove punctuation'>'</span><span class='add punctuation'>’</span>s best to avoid them if we can.</p>
