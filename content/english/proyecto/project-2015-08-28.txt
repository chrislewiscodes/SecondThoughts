Second Thoughts is a program of lectures, workshops, and panel discussions focused on artistic practices that use visual communication and graphic design as mediums and motives of critical research and experimentation. Each edition, with a one-year duration, consists of a series of visits from international artists to Mexico City and culminates in an exhibition and a publication that will bring the work of the participants with that of local artists together.

This edition’s activities will be held at Fundación Alumnos47 and Museo Tamayo. The program will start in November 2015.
