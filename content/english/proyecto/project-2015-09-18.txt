Second Thoughts is a program of lectures, workshops, and panel discussions focused on artistic practices that use visual communication and graphic design as mediums and motives of critical research and experimentation. The project is a one-year initiative consisting of a series of visits from international artists to Mexico City. It will conclude with an exhibition and a publication that will bring together the work of the participants and local artists.

Activities will be held at Fundaci√≥n Alumnos47 and Museo Tamayo. The program starts in November 2015.
