Second Thoughts Series is a project developed by Federico Perez Villoro carried out with thanks to Alumnos 47.

We extend our special thanks to museum Tamayo for their overall support and for facilitating spaces for the activities. We also thank the people who made the project possible, especially Alicia Cheng, Sarah Gephart, Mariana Perez Villoro, Ana Paula Tovar, Humberto Moro, Mario Navarro, Uriel Fern√°ndez Lignian, and Christopher Hamamoto.

The visual identity and the site were designed and developed by Christopher Hamamoto
