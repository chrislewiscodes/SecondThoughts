Second Thoughts is a project of Federico Perez Villoro developed with the support of alumnos47

We extend our special thanks to Museum Tamayo for facilitating its spaces and contribute to the promotion of the activities. Also we thank everyone who made possible the realization of the project, especially to Alicia Cheng, Sarah Gephart, Mariana Perez Villoro, Ana Paula Tovar, Uriel Fern√°ndez Lignian, Christopher Hamamoto, and David Reinfurt.

The visual identity and the website were designed and developed by Christopher Hamamoto
