# David Reinfurt

David Reinfurt is an artist, writer, and designer based in NYC whose work integrates highly conceptual ideas with technological experimentation. In 2000, Reinfurt founded the design studio O-R-G, a practice composed of a constantly shifting network of collaborators. 

In 2006, with stuart bailey, Reinfurt established Dexter Sinister, a small workshop in the lower east side of New York City—running counter to contemporary large-scale publishing. Following transformations in industrial product manufacturing, Dexter Sinister applies postfordist ideas such as just in time economies and print on demand, uses inexpensive local machinery, and considers web based distribution strategies. Trough a combination of active research, speculative projects, and an expanded practice in design, Dexter Sinister addresses the reach of visual communication as a means to generate knowledge and circulate information. The workshop is responsible for the magazine dot dot dot and for The Serving Library: a virtual archive and a physical library.

# Constant Dullaart

Constant Dullaart is an artist based in Berlin. Interested in the vernacular of communication strategies and tools, and in the internet understood as a public space, Dullaart investigates the aesthetic and structural aspects of mass media and of the channels by which we have access to information. His approach is political and critical to institutional and corporate systems influencing contemporary semantics.

Through websites, performances, and installations, Dullaart sets into play the dialectics of notions such as “private” and “public”, “physical” and “digital”, “offline” and “online” dissolving their previously binary nature. Recent projects include Jennifer in Paradise, a digital restoration of the first image ever Photoshopped; Treasure of Lima, an encrypted code with the location of a container with numerous artworks by leading artists buried in an island at the Caribbean shore; and dozens of websites designed as spaces of institutional critique and anti-corporation protest. Here it stands out a series of explorations Dullaart did with Google’s interface, and for which the company increased the security of their code.

Dullaart is a former resident of the Rijksakademie and currently holds a teaching position at The Werkplaats Typografie in Arnhem. His work has been exhibited at places such as MASS MoCA, UMCA, the New Museum, Polytechnic Museum, Autocenter, de Appel, W139, and the Stedelijk Museum.
