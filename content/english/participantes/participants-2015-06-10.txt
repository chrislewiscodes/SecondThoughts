# David Reinfurt

David Reinfurt combines highly conceptual ideas with technological experimentation. After receiving his MFA in Graphic Design from Yale in 1999 and worked at IDEO in San Francisco, he founded ORG, a design studio composed of a network constantly rotating partners.

In 2006, together with Stuart Bailey, Reinfurt established Dexter Sinister, a small publishing workshop that runs contrary to the realities of the editorial production of large-scale. Following the example of the transformations in the world of industrial manufacturing, Dexter Sinister applies post-fordist ideas like "just-in-time" economies, using inexpensive local machines, and digital distribution strategies to collapse distinctions between writing, editing, design, production, and distribution. Through active research and speculative projects, Dexter Sinister addresses the reach of graphic design to generate knowledge. The workshop is responsible for publications such as the acclaimed art magazine Dot Dot Dot and The Serving Library: an virtual archive and a small physical library that feed each other.
