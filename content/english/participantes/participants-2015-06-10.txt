# David Reinfurt

David Reinfurt combines highly conceptual ideas with technological experimentation. After receiving his MFA in Graphic Design from Yale in 1999 and worked at IDEO in San Francisco, he founded ORG, a design studio composed of a network constantly rotating partners.

In 2006, together with Stuart Bailey, Reinfurt established Dexter Sinister, a small publishing workshop that runs contrary to the realities of the editorial production of large-scale. Following the example of the transformations in the world of industrial manufacturing, Dexter Sinister applies post-fordist ideas like "just-in-time" economies, using inexpensive local machines, and digital distribution strategies to collapse distinctions between writing, editing, design, production, and distribution. Through active research and speculative projects, Dexter Sinister addresses the reach of graphic design to generate knowledge. The workshop is responsible for publications such as the acclaimed art magazine Dot Dot Dot and The Serving Library: an virtual archive and a small physical library that feed each other.

David Reinfurt has taught at Princeton University, Yale, Columbia and Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), the Royal College of Art in London and Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. In 2010, he was appointed United States Artists Rockefeller Fellow, and previously, in 2006 and 2007 he was a member at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT. His work has been exhibited widely including at the 2008 Whitney Biennial and the Venice Biennale in 2013 and is part of the permanent collections of the Walker Art Center, the Whitney Museum, the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).

# Constant Dullaart

Constant Dullaart is an artist based in Berlin working with the tools of communication and uses the Internet as a public space. In 2002 he graduated from the Gerrit Rietveld Academie and from 2007 to 2008 and was a resident of the Rijksakademie. Interested in the vernacular of digital media and the Internet, his approach is political critical of institutional systems influencing contemporary semantics.

Through minimal gestures and sometimes precarious, his work investigates the effects and affects of media and contemporary communication platforms, and often takes the form of web pages, performances, installations and images found on the internet and manipulated in various ways. Among his most recent projects include Jennifer in Paradise, which is the digital restoration and series of visual exploration of the first image ever modified in Photoshop, and Treasure of Lima, a printed three-dimensional cylinder with the coded location of a container containing dozens of works by important artists that was buried on an island hundreds of kilometers away from Costa Rica.

Dullaart has lectured at many universities and is a professor at Werkplaats Typografie. His work has been exhibited at MASS MoCA, UMCA, New Museum in New York, Moscow Polytechnic Museum, Autocenter in Berlin, and Appel, W139, and the Stedelijk Museum.
