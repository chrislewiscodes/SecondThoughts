# David Reinfurt

David Reinfurt is an artist, writer, and designer based in New York whose work integrates highly conceptual ideas with technological experimentation. In 2000, Reinfurt founded O-R-G, a design studio made up of a constantly shifting network of collaborators. In 2006, Reinfurt, along with Stuart Bailey, established Dexter Sinister, a small workshop that works contrary to large-scale contemporary publishing. Following the transformations in industrial product manufacturing, Dexter Sinister applies post-fordist ideas such as Just-In-Time economies, uses inexpensive local machinery and web based distribution strategies. Through a combination of active research, speculative projects, and an extended practice in design, Dexter Sinister addresses the scope of visual communication as a means to generate knowledge and circulate information. The workshop is responsible for the acclaimed magazine “Dot Dot Dot” and “The Serving Library,” a virtual archive and a physical library that reciprocally feed each other.

# Constant Dullaart

Constant Dullaart is an artist based in Berlin whose work explores the vernacular of communication tools and the Internet understood as a public space. Dullaart is interested in the aesthetic and structural aspects of mass media and the channels by which we can access information. His approach is political and critiques institutional and corporate systems influencing contemporary semantics.

![a1](img/dullaart/5.jpg) Through websites, performances, and installations, Dullaart sets into play the dialectics of notions such as “private” and “public,” “physical” and “digital,” “offline” and “online,” dissolving their binary nature. Recent projects include “Jennifer in Paradise,” a digital restoration of the first ever photoshopped image; “Treasure of Lima,” an encrypted code with the location of a container with artworks by leading artists, buried in a Caribbean island; and dozens of websites designed as spaces of institutional critique and anti-corporation protest, where a series of explorations with the Google interface stands out.Dullaart is a former resident of the Rijksakademie and currently holds a teaching position at the Werkplaats Typografie in Arnhem. His work has been exhibited in places such as MASS MoCA, UMCA, the New Museum, Polytechnic Museum, Autocenter, de Appel, W139, and the Stedelijk Museum.
