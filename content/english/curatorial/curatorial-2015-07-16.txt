Art has a long tradition of defying its institutions and dominant economic models, however, it is also participating in a transition to the forms of hypercapitalization that are establishing themselves as the political paradigm. On one hand industries are focusing on services where the transmission of information is essential, and work procedures require subjective and creative abilities, on the other hand, tasks directly devoted to culture are subjected to the norms of capitalist production. Contemporary artists have become archetypal figures of the current condition of labor but if this is true, how can they make criticisms against the same power structures sustaining them?

Artists are implementing visual communication to integrate radical ideas in appealing products to the general public. In this regard, graphic design is exercised as a postconceptual resource and as a means of access between the artistic world and commercial endeavors. 

Through recontextualizing preexisting material, the discursive possibilities in the acts of collecting, selecting, organizing and distributing content unfolds—calling into question the notions of authorship that maintains the privileged position of the artist. Likewise, the mutability and reproducibility of information in different mediums, dismantles the supremacy of the unique art object and, in the process, demystifies how market and political forces regulate the circulation of culture and knowledge.

With new technologies available, artists investigate spaces of discontent, exercising propositions along a wide variety of activities ranging from new approaches to intellectual property, such as open source softwares and copyleft licensing; Post-Fordist manufacturing techniques; counter-corporate surveillance and governmental censorship operations; self-sustaining initiatives such as the DIY movement; to self-governed, and in many cases even illegal, modes of entrepreneurship—such as piracy and the black market.
