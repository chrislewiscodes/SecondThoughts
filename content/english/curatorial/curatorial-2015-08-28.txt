Art has a long tradition of defying its institutional systems and dominant economic models; however, it is also part of the transition towards the forms of hypercapitalization that seem to establish themselves as the global political paradigm. On one hand, industries are focusing on services where the transmission of information is essential and manpower requires creative, speculative, and subjective procedures. On the other, tasks directly devoted to culture are increasingly subjected to the norms of capitalist production. Contemporary artists have become archetypal figures of the current labor conditions. But, if the latter were true, how can artists make meaningful criticism against the same power structures that sustain them?

In recent years, artists have implemented visual communication strategies that integrate radical ideas with accessible and potentially appealing products for the broader public. In this regard, graphic design is exercised as a post-conceptual resource and as a means of mutual access between the art world and its commercial endeavors. 

Through recontextualizing preexisting material, the discursive potencial of the acts of collecting, selecting, organizing and distributing content unfoldsâ€” questioning the notions of authorship that maintain the privileged position of the artist within the cultural hierarchy. Likewise, the mutability and reproducibility of information through different mediums dismantles the supremacy of the unique art object and, in the process, demystifies how economic and political forces regulate the flow of culture and knowledge.

With new technologies available, artists and designers explore spaces of social discontent, exercising propositions within a wide variety of activities, ranging from new approaches to intellectual property, such as open source software and copyleft licensing; Post-Fordist manufacturing techniques; counter-corporate surveillance and government censorship operations; self-sustaining initiatives such as the DIY movement, to self-governed and, in many cases, even illegal modes of entrepreneurship such as piracy and the black market.
