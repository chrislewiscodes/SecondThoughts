Art has a tradition of defying its institutions and dominant economic models; however, it is part of the transition towards the forms of hypercapitalization that seem to establish themselves as the political paradigm. On one hand, industries are focusing on services where information is essential and manpower requires creative, speculative and subjective procedures. On the other, tasks devoted to culture are subjected to the norms of capitalist production. Contemporary artists have become archetypal figures of the labor conditions. But, if the latter were true, how can artists make meaningful criticism against the power structures that sustain them?

In recent years art practices that implement visual communication strategies have emerged. Graphic design is being exercised as a Post-Conceptual resource and as a means to integrate radical ideas in appealing, and accessible products for the broader public. 

Through recontextualizing material, the discursive potencial of the acts of collecting, selecting, archiving, organizing, and distributing content unfoldsâ€” questioning the notions and fundamentals of authorship that maintain the privileged position of the artist within the cultural hierarchy. Likewise, the mutability and reproducibility of information through different mediums dismantles the supremacy of the unique art object and, demystifies how economic and political forces regulate the flow of culture and knowledge.

With new technologies available, artists explore spaces of social discontent, exercising propositions within a wide variety of activities, ranging from new approaches to intellectual property, such as open source software and copyleft licensing; Post-Fordist manufacturing techniques; counter-corporate surveillance and government censorship operations; self-sustaining initiatives such as the DIY movement, to self-governed and, in many cases, even illegal modes of entrepreneurship such as piracy and the black market.
