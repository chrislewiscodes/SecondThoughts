Art production has a long tradition of defying dominant economic models, however, it also contributes to the forms of hypercapitalism that seem to establish themselves as the global political paradigm. On one hand, industries are focusing on services where communication is essential and manpower requires creative, speculative, and intellectual procedures. On the other, tasks directly devoted to culture are increasingly subjected to the norms of their markets. Contemporary artists have become archetypal figures of the current labor conditions. If this is true, how can they make meaningful criticism against the same power structures that sustain them?

In recent years, artists that implement visual communication strategies in their work have proliferated. Graphic design is exercised as a post-conceptual resource: as a means to integrate radical ideas in appealing and accessible products for the broader public. 

By working with preexisting material, the discursive possibilities of the acts of collecting, selecting, organizing and distributing content unfold, calling into question the notions of authorship that have placed the artist in a privileged position within the cultural hierarchy. Likewise, the mutability and reproducibility of information through different mediums dismantles the supremacy of the unique art object and, in the process, reveals how institutional systems and economic forces regulate the flow of knowledge.

With new technologies available, artists and designers explore spaces of social discontent with a variety of approaches. These include propositions to intellectual property such as open source software and copyleft licensing, post-fordist manufacturing techniques, counter-corporate surveillance and government censorship initiatives, self-sustaining operations such as the DIY movement, and self-governed and, in many cases, illegal modes of entrepreneurship such as piracy and the black market.
