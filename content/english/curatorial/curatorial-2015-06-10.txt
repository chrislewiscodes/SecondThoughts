Art has a long tradition defying its institutional system and dominant economic models, however, today is participant to the transition to the forms of hypercapitalization that seem to be establishing as the global political paradigm. On the one hand, industries have focused on services where the transmission of information is essential, and where work procedures require subjective, speculative, and creative abilities. On the other hand, tasks directly devoted to culture are increasingly subjected to the norms of capitalist production. Contemporary artists have become archetypal figures of the current condition of labor. but if the latter were true, how can artist make meaningful criticism against the same power structures sustaining them?

Since recent years, artists are implementing visual communication strategies to integrate radical ideas with accessible and potentially appealing products to the general public. In this regard, graphic design is being exercised as a postconceptual resource and as a means of mutual access between the art world and commercial endeavors. Through recontextualizing preexisting material, the discursive possibilities of the acts of collecting, selecting, organizing and distributing content unfolds, calling into question the notions of authorship that maintain the privileged position of the artist as a genius-creator. Likewise, the mutability and reproducibility of information in different mediums, dismantles the supremacy of the unique art object and, in the process, demystifies how market forces regulate the circulation of culture and knowledge.
